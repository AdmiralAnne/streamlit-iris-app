# 💐 Iris Flower Classification with Streamlit 💐

Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification app! 🌸 This app predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements. 🌺

### ✨ Features? idk...

* 🌷 **Interactive Interface:** Easily input flower measurements using sliders.
* 🔍 **Species Prediction:** Predict the Iris species using a pre-trained SVM model.
* 📋 **Prediction Display:** View the predicted species name instantly.
* 📊 **Expandable Dataset Section:** Explore the underlying dataset.

### 🚀 Usage

1. 📥 Clone this repository or download the code.
2. 🔧 Install required libraries (`streamlit`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`).
